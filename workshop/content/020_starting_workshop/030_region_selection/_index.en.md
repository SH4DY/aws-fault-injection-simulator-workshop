This workshop relies heavily on AWS Fault Injection simulator and assumes that you will be running all your experiments in the same region. FIS is currently available in the [regions listed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/fis.html#fis_region). 

If not otherwise instructed, please _pick an appropriate region_ from the list and perform all the operations in the workshop in that region.
