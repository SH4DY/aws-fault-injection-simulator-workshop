In this section you will find two experiments. First you will spin up a service on [**Amazon Elastic Container Service**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS) and improve its resilience. 
Second, you will work with an ECS task that represents something like a recurring batch job and use FIS to stop it, improve it and re-test it.

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere.
