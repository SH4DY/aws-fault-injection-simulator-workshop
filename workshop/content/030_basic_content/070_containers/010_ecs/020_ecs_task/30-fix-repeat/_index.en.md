## Learning and Improving

In the previous section we have identified some issues with our current setup: our ECS cluster only had **one** instance and our application's ECS Service desired capacity was set to `1`. Now, let's improve our infrastructure setup. 

### Increase the number of instances 

### Increase the number of tasks


## Repeat the experiment



## ECS further learning

For more on ECS configurations see the [ECS workshop](https://ecsworkshop.com/).
