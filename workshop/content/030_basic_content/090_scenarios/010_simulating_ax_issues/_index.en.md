A common ask we hear is for "AZ outage" simulation. Because AWS has spent more than a decade working to _prevent_ exactly those scenarios and to self-heal any disruption, there is currently no easy button solution to simulate this. 

In this section we will failure paths you can group together to build an experiment that approximates an AZ failure for your particular workload.
